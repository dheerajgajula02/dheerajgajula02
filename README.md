### Hi there, I'm Dheeraj Gajula 😁👋

#### To see stuff I do in my sites visit https://index.dheerajg.me <br>
note that most of my sites are not in index for obvious reasons, they're critical , but if you're interviwing me ask me, I'm more than happy to explain <br>
I'm all about privacy I'm not logging any IP address , cloudflare might log some for their metrics but my backend wont.
most of my servies are IPV6, you can read all those in the index, the index page runs dual stack.

I'm a Network and software engineer, interested in building homelabs infra, backend developer (golang) , devops <br>
I'm majoring in computer science and Network engineering <br>
I have a (I'd like to think ) decent home lab setup with enough redundancies to required services <br>
I do stupid stuff to my laptop and phone <br>
Don't hesistate to reach out to me for collaboration. <br>
I Know good amount of backend too. <br>

portfolio: https://v6.dheerajg.me / https://portfolio.dheerajg.me ( if you know your wifi supports ipv6 ) 
note : if you're seeing this from CU boulder connected to UCB guest or UCB wireless it won't work because it doesn't support dual stack :).


else : https://resume.dheerajg.me ( ipv4 )

note: at any given point of time anyone of these 3 should be up.
